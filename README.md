"Elevator" is the implementation of elevator oop - a set of entities (components of the business process) and the relationships between them.
Within the framework of the current implementation, the following set of objects was defined:
     name;
     type;
     move up or down;
     carrying;
     color;
     light;
     material;
     speed;
    in this application polymorphism  is movement up or down. when a person calls the elevator, the light comes on and the elevator moves to the floor and opens the doors. encapsulation in the application access to the function of calling the elevator to come to the floor. inheritance from parent class: doors, square cab shape, travels up and down. Subclasses freight elevator (can carry cargo) and passenger (faster delivers people to the floor).
